Project Title  
SOC and Cloud Security Analysis Labs

Project Overview  
This repository documents structured Security Operations Center (SOC) and cloud security analysis exercises performed in controlled lab environments. The objective of this project is to understand modern attack techniques, detection challenges, and response considerations across on-premise and cloud-based infrastructures.

The focus of this work is on threat visibility, analysis, and security impact rather than offensive exploitation.

Scope of Activities  
- Command-and-Control (C2) behavior analysis  
- Evasion technique awareness and detection challenges  
- Cloud attack scenarios and privilege abuse patterns  
- Security event analysis and reporting  
- End-to-end capstone security assessment  

Key Exercises Performed  
- Analysis of advanced C2 communication techniques  
- Study of attacker evasion methods and detection gaps  
- Cloud attack simulations and misconfiguration abuse scenarios  
- Security assessment documentation and reporting  
- Consolidated capstone project covering multiple attack vectors  

Tools and Concepts  
- SOC detection and alert analysis concepts  
- Cloud security fundamentals and attack patterns  
- Security event correlation and investigation methodology  
- Risk assessment and reporting practices  

Reporting and Documentation  
Significant emphasis was placed on producing clear, structured security documentation, including:
- Description of observed attacker behavior  
- Impact analysis from a security and business perspective  
- High-level mitigation and remediation considerations  
- Executive-style reporting suitable for enterprise environments  

Ethical Disclaimer  
All activities documented in this repository were conducted in isolated, authorized lab environments strictly for educational and skill development purposes. No testing was performed against live, production, or unauthorized systems.

Key Learnings  
- Improved understanding of SOC monitoring challenges  
- Awareness of cloud-specific attack surfaces and risks  
- Importance of visibility, detection, and response readiness  
- Value of structured reporting in security operations  

Future Enhancements  
- Mapping activities to the MITRE ATT&CK framework  
- Inclusion of detection logic and SIEM use-case perspectives  
- Expansion into incident response workflows
